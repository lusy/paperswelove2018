% Operationalizing Conflict and Cooperation between Automated Software Agents in Wikipedia: A Replication and Expansion of “Even Good Bots Fight”
% Papers We Love Berlin October 2018

---

# Why

* master's thesis
* methodology! --> open science
* replication study! (all these news about wrong papers)

---

# Aim of the paper

* who's actually read it?

research question: "to what extent are bot-bot reverts
in Wikipedia genuine conflicts where disagreements about how Wikipedia ought to be written were
embedded in opposing bot codebases, versus cases like Shoreland’s Addbot that reflect the opposite?"

---

# Who are the authors

background: wikipedia researchers + long-time contributors

## Geiger

## Halfaker

---

# Structure of the paper

* show all of it and specifically emphasize parts I find interesting/important

* introductory vignette
* authors' positioning
* epistemology
* operationalise key terms
* important metrics
* limitations

---

# Context of the paper

* more about Wikipedia/bots/current debates?
  ** paper has literature review on Conflict in Social Computing; Conflict in Wikipedia; Bot governance
* short summary of "Even Good Bots Fight"

# Operationalising conflict

* conflict according to "Even good bots fight": bot-bot reverts
"The EGBF paper operationalized
bot-bot conflict through reverts, which is when one user account undoes another user account’s
edit." // Geiger+Halfaker operationalisieren den Begriff differenzierter

* conflict according to Geiger and Halfaker
it's a culturally specific concept!
Conflict typology:
task conflict
process conflict
relationship conflict
Types of conflicts:
* bot-bot conflict: bots are programed with opposing directives --> not many cases found
* conflict about bots: human editors in conflict over what bots ought to be developed --> many cases found, conflict not limited to discussions about bots though, part of day-to-day work on Wikipedia
* sometimes conflict turns interpersonal

# What is actually a bot

* according to the paper?
* assemblage bot-developer(operator)

-What-Who is a bot? --> Bot Def!!
"for us, bots are inextricably linked to their developers, rather than autonomous agents who can
be studied independently of the people who develop and operate them. Speaking to this, many
Wikipedia bot developers name their bot not after the task it does, but after themselves: CydeBot
is run by a user named Cyde, Addbot is run by Adam Shoreland (whose username is Addshore),
CyberBot is run by a user named Cyberpower678, Xqbot is run by a user named Xqt, and more."

# Methodology

* trace ethnography
trace ethnography: "seek to understand data in the context it has within a community of practice," "data to be a starting point for further contextualization and interpretation,"
TODO: further notes on trace ethnography
trace literacy --> get to know the community; know how to participate in it
What are the traces they looked at:
- start with the revision ID of an identified bot-bot revert
- follow other traces to find other contextual information, such as:
  - what was changed in the revert,
  - the bot developer’s summary of what the bot was doing at the time,
  - the other edits that both bots had made,
  - both bots’ Requests for Approval before the Bot Approvals Group (if any),
  - the various talk pages where Wikipedians would raise and resolve the conflict (in cases of genuine conflict),
  - and the various policies and guidelines in force at the time of the revert.


* cooking data with care
* epistemology?

iterative mixed method
combination of:
* quantitative methods: mining big data sets/computational social science
"begin with one or
more large (but often thin) datasets generated by a software platform, which has recorded digital
traces that users leave in interacting on that platform. Such researchers then seek to mine as much
signal and significance from these found datasets as they can at scale in order to answer a research
question"
* more traditional social science/qualitative methods, e.g. interviews, observations, experiments

# Dataset

("The dataset released by the EGBF authors only
ranges from 2001-2010, does not contain full metadata for each edit, and was generated by software
code that is not publicly available.")

* how was it generated
  * identify bots
        * bot user group (limitations: bots get frequently removed from/unflagged when they are no longer active)
        * user_former_groups : former bots
        * "Bot user" cross-wiki category
        --> 6522 current and former bots identified across all language versions
  * identify reverts with: https://github.com/mediawiki-utilities/python-mwreverts

* Dec 31 2016
* which language versions does it comprise
English, German, Japanese, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese?
* important metrics
  * time between reverts
  * number of reverts per article for the same bot pair

# Various types of bot-bot reverts

* fixing double redirects (evtl diagram)
* migrating interwiki links
- updating of article notification templates (page is protected from editing or has some issue; template removed when the issue is resolved)
- moving categories
- editing "per" justification: "single purpose bots that are written to implement a decision reached
by Wikipedians that applies to many articles in a category or even across the encyclopedia." --> may be reverted when consensus change again

* conflict
  * conflict between bots (programmed with opposing directives)
  * conflict between developers about bots: developers don't agree over what the bots should be doing
  * interpersonal conflict
  * conflict can be productive if resolved in a sensible/healthy manner
conflict: not necessary negative, but can be generative and stimulating (avoid filter bubbles) if resolved in a respectful manner
Conflicts - specific cases:
- Mathbot and Frescobot over link syntax.
  - no fundamental disagreement between developers about what ought to be done
  - bots still programmed with opposing tasks
  - took over 2 years before it was noticed
- Mathbot's disambiguation links
  - conflict/disagreement between Wikipedians about: first task, then process and at the end it also turned to interpersonal for some people
- Archiving links: AnomieBot vs CyberBot II.
  - 41 revert sequence on a single page over the course of only 4 days,
  - most intensive bot-bot revert war in our dataset in terms of reverts per page per day
  - task conflict; one of the bots had a bug

# Limitations

* limitations in found data: the traces they work with have a primary purpose other than facilitating scientific research
* limitations in trace ethnography: although Wikipedia is an open system, data do not speak for themselves, but contextual knowledge is needed
* primary language of both authors is English
* "We are humans and humans make mistakes."

---

# Key insights

* only a very small amount of the bot-bot reverts are cases of genuine conflict
    fast reverts: more likely to constitute a conflict
    consensus can change: bots make articles comply with new policies in bulk
* majority of reverts: cases of routine collaborative work between bots
    "we found a substantial amount of
    bot-bot reverts were undoing an edit the other bot had made months, even years after."
    median time to revert: 62 days; and it's been rising over time

    "93.2% of
    bot-bot reverts were not reciprocated or other-
    wise responded to by the bot that was reverted."

Conclusion:
"We found that the overwhelming majority of bot-bot reverts on articles are better characterized as
routine, productive, and even collaborative work between bots."
edit wars < 4% of reverts (more like 0.5%)

* do not tear data out of context! apply critical scrutiny to your whole process
"There is inevitably something left behind or incompletely captured in any transcription or
translation of an entity or event in the world [10, 42, 70]."
("All models are wrong..")

# What's so great about the paper (same as "Why"?)

* the positioning of the authors; objectivity from a unmarked perspective vs situated knowledges
* repos
